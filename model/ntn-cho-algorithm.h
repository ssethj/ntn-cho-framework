 *
 * NTN Conditional Handover Algorithm
 *
 * Implements the 3GPP TS 38.331 CHO state machine with a novel TTE-aware
 * candidate cell selection mechanism for non-terrestrial networks.
 *
 * The algorithm:
 * 1. Network configures CHO with candidate cells and trigger type
 * 2. UE periodically monitors conditions (D1 location, signal quality)
 * 3. When conditions are met, TTE is computed for each candidate
 * 4. NOVEL: Candidate with longest TTE (above minimum) and sufficient
 *    signal quality is selected
 * 5. Handover executes to pre-selected candidate when serving cell degrades
 *
 * Standards positioning of the trigger classes (precise):
 *   - CondEvents A4, T1 (time) and D1 (distance) are Rel-17 NORMATIVE
 *     (TS 38.331 §5.5.4); in Rel-17 T1/D1 are configured TOGETHER WITH A4,
 *     not standalone (see ChoConfig::combineWithA4).
 *   - CondEvent D2 (distance with MOVING reference locations derived from
 *     the broadcast ephemeris) is Rel-18 (TS 38.331 §5.5.4.15a).
 *   - The elevation and timing-advance triggers are TR 38.821 §6 STUDIED
 *     mechanisms, not standardized CondEvents.
 *
